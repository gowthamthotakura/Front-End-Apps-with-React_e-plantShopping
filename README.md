E - Plant Shopping

I have created a shopping cart application for an online plant shop that offers a variety of house plants.
The Paradise Nursery shopping cart features includes:
1.	A Landing page with a button linking to the product listing page
2.	A navigation bar with links to the landing, product listing, and shopping cart pages
3.	A card for each plant that showcases the different plants along with their images, names, descriptions, costs and an Add to Cart button.
4.	A minimum of two sections describing the plants in that section. For example, "Aromatic Plants" and "Medicinal Plants".
5.	A cart page that displays the products in the cart.
6.	The cart should have a card for each type of plant in the cart. Each card should have the thumbnail, the unit cost, the cost for all the plants of that type and buttons to increase and decrease the quantity along with the Delete button.
7.	A Continue Shopping and Checkout buttons


Learning objectives:

Created function React components composed and nested them.

Implemented React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks, to manage component-level states.

Integrated Redux within your React application and applied Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.

Dynamically rendered data fetched from an array of objects onto the UI. You mapped over arrays to generate lists of components.

Handled user events such as button selection and triggered corresponding actions to add and remove items in the cart.
